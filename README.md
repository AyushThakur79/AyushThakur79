# Designer & Developer → Figma. Webflow. GSAP.

Designing experiences that feel as good as they look—that’s what drives me as a UI/UX Designer. I’m actively honing my skills in UI/UX design and Webflow development (Front-End Development), bringing ideas to life with Figma and Webflow while focusing on creating intuitive, engaging interfaces.

With a strong grasp of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and libraries like GSAP and SwiperJS, I craft responsive, interactive designs that are smooth, engaging, and built for modern users. Right now, I’m diving deeper into Webflow to create polished, no-code web experiences.

When I’m not designing, you’ll find me exploring award-winning sites on Awwwards.com, learning from the best, and pushing my creativity forward. For me, it’s all about blending aesthetics with usability to create designs that leave an impact.
