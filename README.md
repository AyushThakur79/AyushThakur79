# Hi! My name is Ayush Thakur | CODE VAULT ðŸ¤–

As an aspiring web designer and front-end developer, I'm passionate about the art and science of web design. With expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I create responsive and visually captivating designs.

Right now, Iâ€™m focused on mastering React and planning to dive into Next.js to stay ahead in modern web development. This blend of technology and design supports my goal of becoming a versatile web designer.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring award-winning sites on Awwwards.com, staying updated on the latest design trends and animations, and sharpening my skills with Figma. This passion drives me to push the boundaries of user experience and shape my future as a web designer.
